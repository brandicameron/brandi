## Always something new to learn:

- First time requiring multiple api fetches, therefore first time using Promise.all.
- It was fun figuring out how to code the css rain/snow, randomizing the drops placement and animation delays using a random number function in inline css.
- First time creating a dark mode theme â€” created using css variables. (dark mode kicks in after dusk in Nashville on the index/weather banner section to indicate nighttime.)
- Dug into Framer Motion a bit more, still a lot to learn.
